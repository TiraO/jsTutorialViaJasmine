# Javascript Learning guide 
For absolute beginners
## Why Javascript?
Javascript is the programming language of the web. That means there are tons of resources out there for getting started with it. In fact, you already have a way of running it installed on your machine--your browser has a javascript interpreter built in.
## Quick getting started tips
I'm not the type to use a book for learning to code, but resource-wise:
- there are lots of online games and courses but I haven't tried any and i don't know which is best.  https://www.codeschool.com , etc.
- install an IDE. I recommend webstorm. It will help you to not make typos that prevent your code from running.  
- find a simple example that you can play around with,  such as in jsfiddle. Eg. Google 'jsfiddle html button' or 'jsfiddle threejs'
Learn how to use the debugger in chrome dev tools. When in doubt, print it out.

Watch out for common gotchas:
- the difference between assignment and comparison ( = vs. ==, <=,  !=)
- variable names can be arbitrary but should be meaningful
- how variables get passed to functions
- assignment puts the value in the lefthand variable, so there can only be on variable left of the =
- when something goes wrong, trust the information you have. Be very systematic in eliminating possibilities.

'Hello world' Assignment
Hello world programs are extremely simple programs that print the words "hello world"
Why? Printing output is the simplest way to prove that technically you can run code. You have a minimal working setup. 
As I mentioned earlier, if you have an internet browser, you have a way of running javascript. Javascript is the language of the web, and so all browsers have javascript interpreters built in. But, some browsers are more developer-friendly than others.  Firefox and Chrome both have an advanced set of developer tools that let you interact with code while it's running. I'm most familiar with chrome, so let's use that.
Open up developer tools and go to the 'console' tab. (Go ahead and google how to do this.)
Type: console.log('hello world');
Press enter.
Chrome will run your line of code through its javascript interpreter and it will print: 'hello world'
Type: console.log(2 + 4);
Press enter.
Chrome will run your line of code through its javascript interpreter and it will print: 6

Try something something else:
Type: 2 + 4
Press enter.
Chrome will run your line of code through its javascript interpreter and it will print: 6
Okay, what's the difference? 

Running things in the console like this is a great place to try things out, but of course you won't always want to run things one line at a time. Let's go play with a more advanced example.

Research is your friend. 
Find a simple jsfiddle example and change it.

stackoverflow.com --this will come up a lot when you are googling your problems and error messages. I've had good experiences asking questions here as well.

github.com -- tons of open-source software. That means you can read the source code, and if you can get it running you can tweak it. Contributing to open-source projects is also a great thing to put on your resume.

git --  git is a version control system. Basically it's for saving backups of different versions of your code so that if you introduce a bug you can go back in time and see why it was working before. It also helps for collaborating with other people. At first you might only be using it to "git clone" other people's code from github, but once you're building something you think is cool, you should learn some git commands and keep your code safe. Unfortunately it's not the most user-friendly program but it is pretty much the industry standard, and there are lots of programs out there for helping you work with git. Many IDEs have built-in git support, and there are also standalone programs like Github for Windows.
